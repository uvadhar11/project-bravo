## LIVE DEPLOYED LINK - test out the website here

https://project-bravo.netlify.app/

## RUNNING THE CODE

# In the ZIP file we turned in to you on canvas, we provided the .env file with the environment variables, so you can just run the following commands to run the site locally:

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
